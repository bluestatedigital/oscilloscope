# oscilloscope
A Hystrix dashboard with spice.

# what it's trying to be
A better dashboard for monitoring Hystrix data. (this should eventually be filled out.)

# important to note
We're using code from Hystrix itself (namely the dashboard stuff to actually draw the command/thread pool metrics and graphs) but potentially other stuff.  We/I have every intent to license things properly, but we may be missing the correct licensing at times.  Please do not hesitate to file an issue if there's a licensing problem.  Open source code is a godsend, but we all want to make sure code is being used rightfully and legally.
